## Overview

Roza has a partially completed dashboard that she needs to finish. She has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

## Summary

I created an HTML HTML/Javascript project that has a customized dashboard with a bar, bubble, and gauge chart for different types of bacteria. The dashboard is able to be filtered by the different bacteria IDs in a drop-down menu. Finally, I changed the color of the square of the title.
